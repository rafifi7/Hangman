# Hangman Game GUI
## Author: Rafee Adnan
## Created 12/21/2023 

Brief Description: Simple Hangman GUI created using Python and tkinter and customtkinter.

Description of Features: You will get a main menu screen when you first launch the game. From here, you can choose to play, read instructions, or quit.
Once you press play, the entry widget will only allow you to continue if you type in a character from the alphabet. If you type non-alphabet characters you will 
get a warning telling you to type a phrase that contains letters. You can only type a string length between 1 and 39 into the entry widget. 
Once you click submit or press enter, empty blanks will show at the top of the screen corresponding to each letter typed previously.
There is also a letters used box at the left, a guess button, a letter entry widget, and an image of your current hangman at the right.
